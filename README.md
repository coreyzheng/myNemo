# 101 - NVIDIA Nemo - A Toolkit for Conversational AI

NVIDIA NeMo is a Python toolkit for building, training, and fine-tuning GPU-accelerated conversational AI models using a simple interface. Using NeMo, researchers and developers can build state-of-the-art conversational AI models using easy-to-use application programming interfaces (APIs). NeMo runs mixed precision compute using Tensor Cores in NVIDIA GPUs and can scale up to multiple GPUs easily to deliver the highest training performance possible.

# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), also known as Speech To Text (STT), refers to the problem of automatically transcribing spoken language. You can use NeMo to transcribe speech using open-sourced pretrained models in 14+ languages, or train your own ASR models.
